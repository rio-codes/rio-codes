I tried to tell you  
I didn't know how to stay  
You believe she can see through  
Cutting at the silent clay  
A relief, beckon deep blue  
Fettered in the magnet sun  
Eat the gun as it feeds you  
Spitting up the oxygen  
Once again  
Once again  
  
Once again, empty horses  
Gallop through the violet door  
Follow red, crooked courses  
Shadows on the moonlit floor  
O my stars, winged creatures  
Gathering in silken height  
Like the last human teachers  
  
Once again, we must bleed new  
Even as the hours shake  
Crystal blood like a dream true  
A ripple in the wound and wake  
You believe, I believe too  
That you are the river of light  
Who I love, that I cling to  
In the belly of the empty night  
  
From the 31st floor of the simulation swarm  
With the drone of fluorescence  
Flicker, fever, fill the form  
With a warm gush, now I wanna touch  
Like we never could before  
I'd fly to you tomorrow, I'm not fighting in this war  
I wanna drop my arms and take your arms  
And walk you to the shore  
  
I remember building an energy shield  
In your room, like a temple  
Swallows in the windless field  
Very thin, with your mother  
Tall as a pale green tree  
Very wild, bright as winter  
Rising with a prism key  
And a child to deliver  
Taken with the blood and vine  
As the first little angel  
  
Little Andy, soft in your newborn skin  
Only one, little Andy, will you return again?  
I believe we can renew  
And you could be my brother  
Once again, fall asleep with our backs against each other  
You believe, I believe too  
That you are the river of light who I love  
That I sing to in the belly of the empty night  
  
From the 31st floor of the simulation swarm  
With the drone of fluorescence  
Flicker, fever, fill the form  
With a warm gush, now I wanna touch  
Like we never could before  
I'd fly to you tomorrow, I'm not fighting in this war  
I wanna drop my arms and take your arms  
And walk you to the shore  
I'd fly to you tomorrow, I'm not fighting in this war  
I wanna drop my arms and take your arms
